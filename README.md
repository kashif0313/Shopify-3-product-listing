# Shopify Liquid File - Displaying Three Products in a Row

Shopify Liquid Files for Product and Collection Links with Conditional Display
Welcome to the GitHub repository! Here, you'll find two separate Liquid files that enable you to display product and collection links with images within your Shopify store. The images will only be displayed when a collection or page is linked using a button under the image.

## File 1
 Product Links with Conditional Display
The first file, named 3 product listing, allows you to display product links along with images. The images will be displayed conditionally when a product link is associated with a button placed under the image. This method enhances user engagement by showing images only when relevant actions are available.

## File 2
Page and Collection Links with Conditional Display
The second file, named 3 product with pages and collection links, provides a broader scope by enabling you to display both pages and collection links alongside images. Similar to the first file, images will be displayed conditionally when either a page or collection link is linked using a button placed under the image. This approach offers versatility in showcasing products and collections while maintaining a clean and interactive interface.
